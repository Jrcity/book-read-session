# Book Reading Sessions.

![Preview Image](/preview.png)

## Intro.

Most at times I find it overwhelming picking a book especially <programming>. I alway overlook when will I finish reading such book and also aware of other books to be read.
Since I don't have a **target** while reading, I easily give up when even close completing the book am reading.
Here is a formular I made for time to be spent when reading any book. I hope you'll like it. ;)

## How to use:-

PG
: Pages
CHP
: Chapters

- By default, read sessions are generated base on **user's input**.
- Pages takes hieger priority because most times people prefer bookmarking by pages.
- Chapters is add for a more comfortable and lenghty timeline (i.e. _books with many chapters._).
